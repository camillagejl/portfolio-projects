Chilaquiles can be served for dinner, but more traditionally, it\u2019s a breakfast dish made with eggs. I decided to use chicken in place of scrambled eggs, but no one says you can\u2019t have both. A lovely fried runny egg would be perfect over these chilaquiles! If frying up fresh tortilla chips is too much work, you can use unsalted store-bought tortilla chips.",
